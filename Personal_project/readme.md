# This script will encrypt every file within the directory the script is located

## v1
Barely working encrypting and decrypting programs

## v2
Key will be encrypted 5 times before it is stored.
Password is needed before files are decrypted. If password is entered 3 times incorrectly, program will end. 

## v3
Added another round of encryption before files are saved. Decryption also working in this version. 

## v4
Instead of scanning for files in the current folder (where the script is placed). Scan all files in homefolders.
